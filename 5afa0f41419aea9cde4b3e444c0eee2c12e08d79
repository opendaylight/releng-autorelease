See:\n\nhttp://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-nitrogen/release-notes/release-notes-nitrogen-sr1.html\n\nWe are now stating that all projects did not contribute any commits to a release have noteworthy changes.\n\nIt does produce an empty list if every project had changes in a release though. Perhaps the real fix is to check if an empty list is produced and print a \"None\" statement.",
