""" This python script is used to determine the order of module dependencies
to be followed while performing merge operation during version bumping process
for a new release.

The order is computed be building a directed graph (dependency tree) from
the list of jobs and performing a topological sort on the graph starting from
the root node. The output is ordered list of jobs.

The script requires 'networkx' module installed within the virtualenv.

Usage: ./determine-merge-order.py

    input-file:     dependency.log
    output-file:    merge-order.log
