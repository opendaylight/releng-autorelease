      "message": "Deleting this submodule makes iotdm-validate-autorelease-carbon fail, so Iotdm has to comment that job out in order to make progress, and then put the job back when added back to autorelease.\nIt would be better to replace the submodule with an empty directory. Or at least I think that is the reason why Bier did not need to comment-out anything when they have been removed.",

      "message": "Git doesn\u0027t allow for empty directories. I don\u0027t know what the right strategy for handling the validate-autorelease-carbon jobs should be. It seems like we now have 3 different project that need to be updated whenever a project is added/removed from a release:\n\n* autorelease\n* distribution\n* jjb\n\nThat seems like we\u0027re going the wrong direction from 2. Ideally, we would have it all stem from autorelease, but I\u0027m not sure how to accomplish that.",
